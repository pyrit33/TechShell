# TechShell
A bash-like shell programmed in C

* Group member(s) is just Cheynne Deloney. I apologize that I didn't ask for permission to work alone.
* Cheyenne Deloney completed the entire program alone. This include the code for prompt, the input, parsing the input, and executing the commands.
* The program is a simple bash-like shell programmed in C that is able to imitate some of the functions of a bash shell (in a rudimentary way). It continues prompting the user for commands until the 'exit' command is entered. The 'help' command lists some of the valid commands for the shell.
* Cloning, Compiliing, and Running the Program:
  -
  - gcc TechShell.c -o TechShell
  - ./TechShell.c
* The program does not have redirection functionality. It also only changed the directory to the home directory. All other commands should work.
